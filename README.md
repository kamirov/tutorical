# Tutorical
The code (most of it) behind Tutorical - a website that connects tutors and students. I've since archived the website, but there's a demo available at [andreis.space/projects/tutorical/](http://andreis.space/projects/tutorical/).

## Notes
This is a fairly old project, and deserves a good rewrite. I've left the code as written here, but when I come back to it I'll have to modernize and standardize it quite a bit.

If you have any questions about how an aspect of the site works, send me a message at [andrei.khramtsov@gmail.com](mailto:andrei.khramtsov@gmail.com) and I'll be glad to answer.
