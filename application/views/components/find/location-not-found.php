		<p>We use Google Maps to get the coordinates of any location you enter. This lets us get requests/tutors near that location for you. According to Google Maps, <b><?= $readable_location ?></b> isn't a real place! If they're wrong, <?= anchor('#', 'send us an message', 'data-reveal-id="contact-modal"'); ?> and we'll look into it.</p>
		<p>Thanks. You rock.</p>
